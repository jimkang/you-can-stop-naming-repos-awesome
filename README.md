It's no longer necessary to use "awesome" in the names of GitHub knowledge repos!

## Background

There are a lot of (often helpful) knowledge repos that are collections of links to resources related to a topic. For example, if there were an "awesome-pooping" repo, it would have a Markdown file in it that looked like this:

- [Everyone Poops](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133547.Everyone_Poops) - A really good introduction to pooping
- [The CDC on cleaning up rodent poops](https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html) - Sometimes pooping can cause problems, and you do have to be careful.
- [Awesome pooping gifs](https://giphy.com/search/pooping)

Except there would be about 50 links in around 5-10 categories.

These repos are almost always prefixed with "awesome-" in order to do one or more of the following:

- Convey positivity
- Convey informality
- Attract attention

## Dilution

Unfortunately, the prefix "awesome-" has been used so often in these repos, that &mdash; for me, and possibly others &mdash; the prefix "awesome-" does none of these things anymore. Now, I when I click through to these, I have this vague feeling I'm being tricked, like I clicked on an SEO-optimized title.

## Thoughtful word choice is awesome

What can be done other than to name a repo "awesome-something"? Here are some possible approaches.

### Genuinely descriptive words

You can think about the nature of the links you've collected and think of a word that describes that nature. For example, if all of your links are about how to do something, maybe you can name it "how-to-[whatever the topic is]". If all of them are about unconventional approaches to accomplishing something, you can call it "novel-[topic]" or "[topic]-hacks". If they're all about getting started, how about "getting-started-with-[topic]" or "topic-[basics]". I think this way of naming things is hard but worth it.

### Awesome synonyms

[Here are some synonyms for "awesome".](https://www.wordnik.com/words/awesome#relate) Maybe one of them is a better fit for your resources!

### Just skip the descriptor

You don't have to have an enthusiastic-sounding adjective in your repo name to sell it. If your topic is making your own light bulbs, and people want to know about that, they're probably just as likely to check out a repo named "making-light-bulbs" as "awesome-making-light-bulbs". You can call the repo just by the topic name or the topic name with "links" or "resources" or "knowledge". It'll be fine without the "awesome-"!

## Awesome conclusions

I'm not gonna be mad if these knowledge repos continue to be called "awesome-". It does make me a little sad, though, because the "awesome" is sort of the word choice equivalent of a tech bro with a Nerf gun standing on a motorized skateboard. It reminds me of the tech industry preference for loudness, quickness, and enthusiasm over sobriety and thoughtfulness.

(I fully acknowledge that last bit is probably not a reaction shared by most people.)
